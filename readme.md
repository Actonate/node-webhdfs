A WebHDFS module for Node.js

# Disclaimer

I'm not an expert on HDFS. This module has been written as a requirement for a personal project. I am actively using the module and have written tests for it. Your mileage may vary.

# Tests

I used [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for unit testing. They will be required if you want to run the unit tests. To execute the tests, simply `npm test`.
