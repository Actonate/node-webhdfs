A WebHDFS module for Node.js

# About

I am currently following the [WebHDFS REST API documentation](http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r1.0.2/webhdfs.html#Document+Conventions) for the `1.0.2` release, by Apache.

# Disclaimer

I'm not an expert on HDFS. This module has been written as a requirement for a personal project. I am actively using the module and have written tests for it. Your mileage may vary.

# Tests

I use [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for unit testing. They will be required if you want to run the unit tests. To execute the tests, simply `npm test`.
